# Blue Swan Tracker

Blue Swan Tracker is a web-based tool that helps climbers and gym staff keep track of bouldering routes, events and team scores. It was created for the **Blue Swan Bouldering** community and is designed to be easy for anyone to use.

## What You Can Do

- **Sign in easily** – Use your Google account or receive a "magic link" by email.
- **Explore the gym** – The dashboard shows a map and a list of climbing sections so you can see what areas have recently been reset.
- **View routes** – Each section displays photos of the problems along with their grade, colour and any competition points.
- **Log your climbs** – When you complete a route, record your ascent to track your progress and points.
- **Join events** – Check upcoming competitions and clinics, see countdown timers and details, and follow the leaderboard as teams score points.
- **Track your team** – If you are part of a team competition, you can see your team members and their contributions.

Gym staff have an additional admin area where they can manage sections, sets, routes and events.

## Why It Matters

Keeping routes and scores organised helps everyone enjoy their time on the wall. Climbers can see how they are improving, and competitions run more smoothly because the information is all in one place.
